This repository contains a specialized C# library designed to replicate the core functionalities of the standard C <cstring> library. Developed as a foundational project at "Emil Racovita" highschool, it focuses on the algorithmic deconstruction of string manipulation, avoiding high-level built-in .NET methods to demonstrate a deep understanding of data handling.
#Project Structure
CustomStringLibrary.cs: The core logic engine containing static methods for string processing.
Program.cs: A dedicated test suite designed to validate the library against various edge cases and operational scenarios.
Ignat.csproj: The project configuration file for the .NET environment.
